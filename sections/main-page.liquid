        <p class="page-container-text"> Mediclo's journey began in the summer of 2017. Our founder, who has worked in the medical field for over 25 years, felt the need for a more comfortable and stylish line medical apparel. He saw his peers trapped in restricting scrubs that never fit right. We desired to make modern, eco-friendly, and comfortable scrubs while also empowering healthcare professionals with the confidence of knowing they can feel good while looking good. Through this passion for innovative medical apparel and sustainability, Mediclo was founded and has grown ever since.</p>
